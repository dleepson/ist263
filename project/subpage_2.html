    <h2>Popular Espresso Drinks:</h2>

<div class="col-12 d-block d-md-flex col-md-11" id="text-espresso" style="flex:3;">

<p><b>Cappuccino</b>: Consisting of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk froth, some describe this drink as the strong, velvety sister to the latte. The ratio of these factors create the perfect drink for any day and is perfect for a foam lover.</p>

<p><b>Café Latte (AKA Latte)</b>: More often than not, the latte is the one with the flower crafted out of milk foam and allows for the most variation. It is classically made with a double shot of espresso, 6-8 ounces, and a thin layer of milk foam on top. The biggest difference between a latte and cappucino is that lattes have a 1:3 ratio of espresso to milk and cappuccinos have a ratio of 1:2 which is why peole describe this beverage as being less “strong” tasting.</p> 

<p><b>Espresso Macchiato</b>: A traditional macchiato consists of one shot of espresso and a small dollop of foamed milk on top - not caramel and milk like the popularized Starbucks beverage. </p>

<p><b>Caffe Americano (AKA Americano)</b>: An Americano is basically a shot of espresso that has been diluted with hot water. Many coffee shops that do not offer decaf hot coffee, but have decaf espresso will suggest this beverage as an alternative. This has a much fuller taste than brewed coffee does.</p>

<p><b>Flat White</b>: The Australian go-to. Unlike a latte, there is no foam. Flat White’s are only made up of espresso and steamed milk, which some call “microfoam.”</p>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-8" style="flex:3;"> 
        <p><b>Cold Brew</b>: Is it worth the hype? Yes. Cold Brew is made by steeping ground coffee in cold or room temperature water for 12-24 hours. The result is a smooth taste from the elimination of the bitter taste commonly associated with coffee through the steeping process. While you need to wait hours, Cold Brew is a lot less acidic than Iced Coffee and is very enjoyable to sip on.</p>
        <p><b>Pour Over</b>: Unlike your standard drip coffee maker, Pour Over Coffee allows the barista to have full control over the brewing process. If you like black coffee, this is a great option because the flavors of the coffee being served are a lot more bold and distinct.</p>

        <h2>Milk Choices</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-8" style="flex:3;">
        <p>With the growing demand for milk alternatives. Coffee shops now have milk options such as Almond, Oat, and Soy.</p>

        <p><b>Almond</b>: With this milk, it is all about personal preference. It has a strong nutty taste and Almond Milk tends to noticeably separate which is why some people prefer Oat Milk. If you are staying away from added sugar, ask your barista if the Almond Milk being used contains any because some coffee shops use sweetened.</p>
        <p><b>Soy</b>: Widely available across the world, this milk alternative has been in use long before Oat Milk or Almond Milk. It has a smooth taste and milk soy flavor, which makes it a popular alternative, and it is good for those with a nut or gluten allergy. Like Almond Milk, however, Soy Milk can curdle. </p> 
        <p><b>Oat Milk</b>: The creamiest of the milk alternatives. Oat Milk tastes like cereal milk of Cheerios and froths extremely well. It is the milk alternative that has the most comparable taste to regular milk.</p>
