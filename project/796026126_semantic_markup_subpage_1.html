    <h2><a href="https://www.peakscoffeeco.com/">Peaks Coffee Co.</a></h2>

    <p>Think third-wave minimalist coffee shop - that is what Peaks Coffee Co. is. With stellar avocado toast topped with red pepper flakes, sea salt, and lime, it is hard to not visit. Peaks is great at serving up seasonal drinks, like an apple spice latte, and partnering with nearby eateries, like <a href="https://www.thesweetpraxis.com/">Sweet Praxis</a>. Both non meat eaters and vegans alike will find their fix here. Come for the amazing in-house roasted beans, stay for the vibes.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://recesscoffee.com/">Recess Coffee</a></h2>

    <p>Recess is the perfect place to hide for the day to escape and get a bunch of work done. You may even feel inclined to take a nap in one of their squishy couches that just calls you to lay down. Like Peaks, Recess Coffee also makes their beans in-house. There are so many food and drinks options here. Did someone say nutella hot cocoa?! Did someone also say triple decker pb&j?! Yes, and yes. Recess also offers a variety of pastries and non-caffinated drink options, like a tumeric honey latte. This is one place that you can relax in all day and be well fed.  </p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://saltcitycoffee.com/">Salt City Coffee</a></h2>

    <p>Two words: breakfast sandwiches. Salt City is known for serving up a good brew and their signature "Salt City Sunrise Breakfast Sandwich." If you are looking for other food or beverage options they also have you covered. More of a tea person? This is your place - Salt City has 15 loose leaf tea options to choose from. What makes Salt City unique besides the face that they roast their beans in-house, is that they they have board games and other activities laying around. This spot is perfect for students and families alike. </p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://shop.cafekubal.com/">Cafe Kubal</a></h2>
    <img src="media/subpage_picture_5.jpeg" alt="frothy coffee"/>
    <p>Cafe Kubal closed their store on Marshall St. over the summer, but that does not mean they do not make a mean espresso. Cafe Kubal roasts their beans in-house and has a large storefront in downtown Syracuse by Armory Square. A must try is their chocolate chunk banana bread - you will not be sorry. If you are wanting something more savory, try one of their power bowls or opt for a sandwich. Their cold brew is a fan-favorite, but they also have more milk heavy coffee drinks and non-caffinated beverages as well.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="http://hendricks.syr.edu/programs-and-services/peoples-place.html">People's Place</a></h2>
    <img src="media/subpage_picture_6.jpeg" alt="person doing work with coffee"/>
    <p>While this coffee shop is on Syracuse's campus inside Hendrick's Chapel on the quad, it is worth it for the cheap prices and social good aspect. The cafe is completely student run and their coffee is usually no more than $1-$2. On the food menu are bagels and various pastries, and they also sell "day olds" at a discounted price. People's Place is simply inviting and the vibes are immaculate. Something to note is that the cafe is cash only. If you are a student or faculty member, take a minute to enjoy your beverage in the Noble Room next door to the cafe.</p>
