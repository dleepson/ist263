        <h1>About Me -- Daisy Leepson</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Daisy Leepson</strong>. I have lived in over 6 states, but call Atlanta my hometown. Aside from Atlanta, I also find Rhode Island to be another big part of my identity because I lived there for a long time as well. Last semester, however, my parents moved from Atlanta to Boston. Coming to Syracuse after living in cities for most of my life was a big adjustment for me. I am used to the hustle and bustle of a city, but I have learned to enjoy a slower paced life surrounded by nature.</p>
        <p>Aside from the iSchool, I am studying <em>magazine journalism</em> within Newhouse. I really love all things food journalism and food media. My dream would be to work at a major food publication or for an indie one. I have thought about starting my own publication before and can see myself doing that in the future. I am considering going to culinary school after I complete my undergraduate studies. One thing I have learned from interviewing and speaking with industry professionals is that you need to be your own expert. Thus, my idea to attend culinary school was born. Although my main passions lay within magazine journalism, I am in the iSchool because if I want to help with web design or go off on my and start a publication, I need to know how to go about doing so digitally.</p>
